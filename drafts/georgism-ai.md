Georgism is an economic philosophy that proposes a clear distinction
between value produced by enterprise and labor, and the value inherent
in natural resources ("land" for short). Taxation has many purposes
and effects, but to the extent that it is a system of incentives,
taxing industry less and taxing land ownership more seems correct.

## Real estate of the future: mindshare
Instead of land value tax, mindshare tax? Certainly 

> Land should be taxed as much as possible and improvements as little
  as possible.

> – Milton Friedman

> [Rent is extracted by the land owner despite] the palpable and
  complete passiveness of the owner, whose sole activity consists
  [...] in exploiting the progress of social developments, toward
  which he contributes nothing and for which he risks nothing, unlike
  the industrial capitalist.

> – Karl Marx

> A tax upon ground-rents would not raise the rents of houses. It
  would fall altogether upon the owner of the ground-rent, who acts
  always as a monopolist, and exacts the greatest rent which can be
  got for the use of his ground.

> – Adam Smith

> A tax on rent would affect rent only; it would fall wholly on
  landlords, and could not be shifted to any class of consumers. The
  landlord could not raise his rent, because he would leave unaltered
  the difference between the produce obtained from the least
  productive land in cultivation, and that obtained from land of every
  quality.
  
> – David Ricardo


## Land
- Belongs to all humans
- Can be rented out to enterprising capitalists
